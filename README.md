# Spotify Private Playlist Downloader

This project lets you **download songs from a private Spotify playlist** by:
1. Logging into Spotify with Selenium.
2. Extracting the playlist tracks via the embedded `__NEXT_DATA__` JSON.
3. Downloading the corresponding songs from YouTube (best audio) using [`yt-dlp`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) + FFmpeg.

Songs are saved as `.mp3` files in the `songs/` folder. A log file prevents re-downloading the same tracks.
